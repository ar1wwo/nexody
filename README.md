# Nexody

Nexody is a bash script tool meant to ease users into the creation of their own jellyfin music library.<br>
It automatically tags and downloads tracks and provides a fallback for tracks that are less known.

Relies on SoulSeek for tracks downloads, it requires a Spotify Playlist for search queries<br> (Sldl allows other means to do so, but it's currently unsupported with Nexody).<br>
Relies on Spotify, ITunes and MusicBrainz for tag searches.

Nedoxy is made possible thanks to these open source projects: [Sldl](https://github.com/fiso64/slsk-batchdl), [Ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg).

### Binaries of Ffmpeg and Sldl are required and must be in the same folder as Nexody.<br>
### Ffmpeg must be compiled with the following libraries: libfdk_aac, libmp3lame.

To run, give the scripts permission and execute nexody in bash
